        <h3><strong>Timeline of Robert J. Oppenheimer's life</strong></h3>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>1904</strong> - Robert was born in New York City to Jewish
            immigrants from Germany
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1925</strong> - Robert earned a bachelor's degree in
            chemistry.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1927</strong> - Robert earned a doctorate in physics from
            the University of Gottingen in Germany.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1936</strong> - Robert joined the physics department at the
            University of California, Berkeley, where he became a full
            professor.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1942</strong> - Robert was recruited to work on the
            Manhattan Project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1943</strong> - Robert was appointed director of the
            project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with
            developing the first nuclear weapons. His leadership and scientific
            expertise were instrumental in the project's success.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1945</strong> - On July 16, 1945, he was present at the
            first test of the atomic bomb, Trinity. In August 1945, the weapons
            were used against Japan in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
            the only use to date of nuclear weapons in an armed conflict.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1947</strong> - Oppenheimer became the director of the
            Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, and chaired
            the influential General Advisory Committee of the newly created U.S.
            Atomic Energy Commission. He lobbied for international control of
            nuclear power to avert nuclear proliferation and a nuclear arms race
            with the Soviet Union. He opposed the development of the hydrogen
            bomb during a 1949â€“1950 governmental debate on the question and
            subsequently took positions on defense-related issues that provoked
            the ire of some U.S. government and military factions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1954</strong> - During the Second Red Scare, Oppenheimer's
            stances, together with his past associations with the Communist
            Party USA, led to the revocation of his security clearance following
            a 1954 security hearing. This effectively ended his access to the
            government's atomic secrets and thus his career as a nuclear
            physicist.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1967</strong> - Robert died at the age of 62 in
            Princeton,New Jersey.
